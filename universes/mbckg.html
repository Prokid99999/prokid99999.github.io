            Violence, romance, <i>sex, <span style="color: red;">ROMANTIC SEX...</span></i><br>
            No violent romance, though.<br>
            <span style="color: red;"><strong>And sexual violence is met with death.</strong></span><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            Anyway, characters!<br><br>
            Valorie, a grey-skinned, winged dommy mommy<span style="color: black; cursor: default;"> who embraces my personal beliefs about sex.</span><br>
            Amy, a light blue magic user who pretends to not care.<br>
            Amorie, twink/femboy of the previous two's making<span style="color: black; cursor: default;"> and me trying to figure out what gender I am.</span><br>
            Pyna, dual-wielding swordswoman and host of Pynara.<br>
            Pynara, or Pyne, immensely powerful goddess of the mind.<br>
            And Ben Heroblade, the mastermind behind it all.<span style="color: black; cursor:default;"> Me, or at least a persona.</span><br><br>
            Six beings brought together by one goal listed above, to kill every sex offender and child preadator/pedophile. This group is called MASK, and most assassinations can be carried out by one person. Every member is powerful enough that all of them working together could level a few continents' worth of people, without their weapons. The weakest could slaughter ten or so alone.
