            Violence, romance, <i>sex, <span style="color: red;">romantic sex...</span></i><br>
            Not violent romance.<br>
            <span style="color: red;"><strong>And sexual violence is met with death.</strong></span><br><br><br><br>
            Anyway, characters!<br><br>

            Amy, a light blue magic user who pretends to not care.<br>
            Amorie, twink of the previous two's making<br>
            Pyna, dual-wielding swordswoman and host of Pynara.<br>
            Pynara, or Pyne, immensely powerful goddess of the mind.<br>

            Six beings brought together by one goal listed above, along with child preadators. This group is called MASK, and most assassinations can be carried out by one person. Every member is powerful enough that all of them coming together could level a few continents' worth of people, without their weapons. The weakest could slaughter ten alone.
