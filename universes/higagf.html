        <p>
            Two <strong>EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLD</strong> girls in high school meet for, really, the first time after being in the same class for probably a few years. How exactly? One went to watch the other practice (without her knowing), got caught, and ended up kissing and <span style="cursor: help;" title="female oral" onclick="toggle()">eating her out.</span><span id="help" style="display: none; color: yellow;">&#34;Eating someone out&#34; is giving oral to a person with female genitals.</span><br>
            It's hard to explain without names, so here they are:<br><br>
            <a href="../character_sheets/holly.html" style="color: black;"><span style="color: #6b8dc7;">Holly</span></a> is incapable of thinking with a woman on top of her, or pressing her against a wall, or holding her, or... She's really gay. Thinking about girls in <i>gym clothes</i> makes her blush.<br>
            <a href="../character_sheets/sana.html" style="color: black;"><span style="color: red;">Sara</span></a> is the school's best baller and the rare popular girl with a heart.<br>
            <a href="../character_sheets/lanette.html" style="color: black;"><span style="color: #9900ff;">Lanette</span></a> will be important later.
