        <h1><span style="color: #ff7300; font-family: inherit;">A Wish For Power</span></h1>
        <p>
            A world where you have a chance to get your dreams of strength and vengeance, as long as the Deity smiles upon you. Half the people it grants with ability go mad, and if you don't? You'll survive by killing them.<br><br>
            Our main character is a man who calls himself 'S', or Ess, a fire wielder who acts the opposite. Cool and effecient to just about everyone, but if his eyes turn blue, someone's going to turn up with life-altering [or ending] burns.<br>
            The story follows him and his squad of Gifts as they hunt down mad Gifts and deal with people who don't take kindly to outsiders.<span class="hidden"> It sounds dumb in a summary.</span><br><br>
            Squad 1 consists of Ess,<br>
            Maven, Ess's lover, a bubbly and cheerful enby<br>
            A girl with a demonic lie detector in an eye socket<br>
            A guy who's not that smart but has a Gift for strength,<br>
            and another guy [i need to figure out his Gift]
