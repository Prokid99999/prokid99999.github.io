71 - so many changes... I added a page to navigate stories, a couple of things related to HIGAGF, updated a lot of things (double-click 'shit' to get to the character sheets)
    71.1 - this must be the overhaul update; made a lot of organizational changes, updated all the icons, and rewrote MBCKG to use my formatting style
    71.2 - [not me procrastinating higagf by working on everything else :skull:] fixed some bugs from the organization along with making a new icon for forest, dem and leite (i need to come up with a name for that)
    71.3 - added a sort of 'about me' page
    71.4 - added Lanette, more lists to explain things I use in stories, reformatted Character Sheets and added story names to groups of characters
    71.5 - added 'A Wish For Power'
    71.6 - added ages to character sheets, links on the Sexuality and Gender pages, and changed the color of MBCKG

70 - changed a bunch of character sheets and methods of access
    70.1 - those methods of access are so fucking cool, it sounds kinda weird but getting rid of the preview at the bottom left and having to double click something to use the link is super impressive and it took a while to figure out
