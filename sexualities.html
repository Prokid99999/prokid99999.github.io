        <h1>List of sexualities I've used</h1>
        <p>Surprisingly, I don't think I've used straight.<br><span class="hidden"> ha, bet you thought there was nothing here :middle_finger::skull:</span><br>
            Asexual: No feelings of sexual attraction.<span class="hide"> thats me :D</span><br>
            Aromatic: No feelings of romantic attraction.<span class="hide"> this too :)</span><br>
            Queer: Doesn't know who or what they're sexually attracted to.<br>
            Demisexual: Sexual attraction comes after emotional attachment. Demi people often fall for close friends.<br>
            Gay/Lesbian/Homosexual: Sexual attraction to people of the gender you identify as. It's important to note that homosexuality is more than girls liking girls and guys liking guys; two agender people liking each other would be homosexuality.<span class="hide"> I may have made a pact with the Yuri(lesbian in japanese) Demon, most of my characters are lesbians :Pc</span><br>
            Bisexual: Sexual attraction to both male and female.<br>
            Pansexual: Sexual attraction to everybody regardless of gender.<span class="hide"> someone pan could actually want to fuck a pan :o (fucking a pan is entirely possible, just shove the handle up your ass :O)</span><br>
            <br><span class="hide">I AM A CRIMINAL IN SEVENTY-TWO COUNTRIES FOR BEING INCAPABLE OF GIVING A FUCK >:D</span>
