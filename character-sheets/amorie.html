        Dominant femboy with a unique view of the world.<br>Hello. I don't seem to need to tell you my name, what with it written up there, although
        maybe I <i>should</i> make sure you know who I am. My name is Amorie, son of Valorie and Amy. Short femboy who likes being behind people. Also my eyes are yellow, they glow in the dark and let me look at your perspective, y'know, through the camera or at the words on the page.
