        Cursed Technique: Virtual Idol<br>
        1st Grade Sorcerer<br><br>
        Miku Hatsune made a Binding Vow sacrificing her ability to generate her own cursed energy for the ability to siphon cursed energy from her fans. This vow manifested in Hatsune's abiliy to portray emotion; or, rather, in her lack of it. Her eyes are always blank no matter what expression is on her face, her voice has a distinct lack of variation when using her normal tone, and while she can change her tone and pitch, it requires much effort to mimic emotion.<br>
        One benefit of this vow is that because Hatsune cannot generate cursed energy, she can expend whatever cursed energy is within her body to leave herself with none. See 'Fushiguro Toji' and 'Zen'in Maki' for more information about this condition.<br><br>
        Her cursed technique consists of a beam of cursed energy called "Miku Miku Beam." It is activated by saying "beam" and holding two fingers opened in a 'V' next to one or both eyes. "Miku" can be said up to twice before "beam" as a sort of chant, and another hand can be used to increase its effective area.<br>
        The danger of this technique comes wih the raw volume of cursed energy at Hatsune's disposal. Her cursed technique has no limit on its output and range, making its power difficult to gauge. She could ruffle your hair or flatten Japan. Maybe she could split the earth. Only she knows.<br><br>
        Its full chant is:<br>
        "And now..."<br>
        "It's time!"<br>
        "For the moment you've been waiting for!"<br>
        "One...!"<br>
        "Two...!"<br>
        "Three...!"<br>
        "Ready?"<br>
        "Miku Miku BEAM!"<br>

        Domain Expansion: Colorful Stage<br>
        The inside of this domain is, as the name implies, a stage with a crowd. Hatsune is placed onstage as a performer while others are placed in the crowd.<br>
        Its purpose is to give Hatsune time to perform the full chant of Miku Miku Beam.<br>
        Hatsune uses a full-body pose to activate her domain, as opposed to the traditional hand sign. The requirement is "a pose an idol would strike onstage."<br><br>
        <!-- Her 1st-Grade ranking <br><br> -->
        She looks 16 and travels with Luka because she got tired of people treating her as a child, as well as people being more at ease with Luka around than with her alone.
