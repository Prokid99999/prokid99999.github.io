        I don't tune people out, I don't ignore people. I make them stop. Someone insults me? I'll deal karma like a deck of goddamn cards. Someone calls me a faggot? Beat their ass. Bare hands, no magic. I've been offered sex, favors and secrets to curse people. I deny people's payments of their body and probably curse the bastard anyway. They were desperate enough to come to me, after all.<br>
