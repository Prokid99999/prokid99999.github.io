            Cis Male & Cis Female: Self-explainitory. You identify as a man/woman. (he/him and she/her)<br><br>
            Nonbinary[enby]: You identify as something other than male or female. Nonbinary/enby is a blanket term for anybody who doesn't identify as cis male or female, so it covers these genders:<br>
            Demigirl: You identify as female sometimes but not always. (she/they, they/her, something like that)<br>
            Demiboy: You identify as male sometimes but not always. (he/they, they/him, something like that)<br>
            Agender: You are genderless. (they/them)<br>
