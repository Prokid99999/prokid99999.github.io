            <h1>My Boyfriend Can Kill God - Part 1</h1><br>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                So, I've got one hell of a problem; I don't know how to start this story. It's rather long, spanning a good millennium, and a lot of it is boring, repetitive, and… <br>Well, there are parts I will keep private. Although, before I get started, I should probably add a warning. This story contains quite a few themes not suitable for a younger audience, so to quote a favorite game of mine, 'Don't forget to back up Monika's character file.' No, wait, it was 'This game is not suitable for children or those who are easily dismembered.' <i>Disturbed!</i> This story is not suitable for children or those who are easily disturbed. Specifically, there's extreme violence, sexual content, toxic relationships, extreme ideals, extremism… love… <br><span class="new-para">About telling the story; I still don't have a good idea of where to begin. I don't want to go through my whole life, but I don't have another idea of where to start.</span><p>Unless...</p><p>...Yeah... That could work. It'll be easier for me and <i>much</i> more interesting for you.</span><br><span class="new-para">Okay then, I won't start at the beginning. You also won't be following me, at least not immediately, or for, well, most of the story. You'll b<span style="color: #c6c6c6;">e fo</span><span style="color: #828282;">ll</span><span style="color:#393939">owi</span><span style="color: #252525">n</span><span style="color: #101010">g </span><span style="color: #060606">P</span></span></p>

            <h2>Chapter 1<br></h2>
            <p>
                I woke up on an operating table, dizzy and not quite in control of my limbs. The room was brightly lit and blazing white burned my eyes wherever I looked. I closed them and tried to figure out what had happened, why I would be in a hospital room, how badly I was hurt...<br>
                <span class="new-para">Good news: I didn't think I was injured. Bad news?</span><br>
                <span class="new-para">I couldn't remember why I would be here. I couldn't remember anything. My memory started a few seconds ago, when I came to.</span>
                <p>So, naturally, my brain went to panicked shit. <i>Breathe, breathe, calm down...</i></p>
                <p><i>Not that simple. Okay... </i>I searched my mind, scraping out everything I knew. The sky on Earth was blue. I could do math... I took a breath, held it. I didn't seem to be running out of oxygen. Now that I thought about it, I couldn't feel any blood in my body.</p>
                <p>My eyes weren't hurting as much, so I decided to look at my surroundings. I was lying on what I had thought was an operating table, which even at a glance looked more like a workbench. A crapton of scrap metal, wires and various (non-human)limbs were piled so high the surface was barely visible. Someone had been building something mechanical, something humanoid here...</p>
                <p>I lifted my hand up to my face with fingers spread. It was a shiny gray, open at the knuckles where joints and wires were visible. My palm and the back of my hand were twin sheets of metal, sheathing the mechanisms that made my fingers move. Maybe I should have been worried- no I should absolutely been worried; but I wasn't. I slowly squeezed my hand into a fist, unclenched it, moved the rest of my arm around. It was working fine, so I sat up.</p>
                <p>"Hello," an oddly threatening voice said from behind me.<br>
                <span class="new-para">"HO-ly shit!" The words fell out of my mouth as I snapped around, sending a couple metal sheets clanging to the floor and a curtain of black hair into my face.</span>
                <span class="new-para">"Caught you off guard, huh? Sorry."</span></p>
                <p>Looking at them, they were certainly something. Short and shaggy dark blue hair, a hoodie in a close color, half-unzipped with the shoulders cut out to reveal a black, long-sleeved shirt and grey sweatpants. Half of their face was a dark screen, two tall blue circles making a damn good illusion of eyes. The other half was the same metal as my hand, a mouth curled in an apologetic smile and no nose. They seemed friendly, though they sent irrational fear boiling in my stomach. They seemed like one of those serial killers who were completely normal people outside of the, y'know, murder.</p>
                <p>"So, how're you feeling?"<br>
                <span class="new-para">"Um- I'm fine." Their voice was still intimidating somehow. I shoved the fear away, determined to talk to them and figure out what the hell was going on.</span><br>
                <span class="new-para">"Why are you scared?" they said, cocking their head to the side.</span><br>
                <span class="new-para">"I-I'm not." <i>What, can this guy smell fear or something?</i><br></span>
                <span class="new-para">"Are you sure? Fear's a pretty clear emotion, especially if you know what to look for."<br></span>
                <span class="new-para">"So you can just tell if someone's afraid?"</span><br>
                <span class="new-para">They laughed and said, "That's what a thousand years of reading people can do for you."<br></span>
                <span class="new-para">"..."<br></span>
                <span class="new-para">"That's disbelief. It's like a word for what you're thinking's written on your face."<br></span>
                <span class="new-para">"...That's not weird at all."<br></span>
                <span class="new-para">"Weird can't begin to describe me."<br></span>
                <span class="new-para"><i>Is this guy crazy?</i><br></span>
                <span class="new-para">"I'm not <i>that</i> insane."<br></span>
                <span class="new-para">"What, can you read my thoughts now?"<br></span>
                <span class="new-para">"No, like I said, you're easy to read."<br></span>
                <span class="new-para">"Thanks." I made sure that sarcasm wasn't dripping, but absolutely <i>flooding</i> off my voice.<br></span>
                <span class="new-para">"Ah, I probably should've introduced myself by now. My name is Ben, male, couldn't care less about romance." With a chuckle, they-<i>he</i> added, "Insanity extraordinaire."</p>
                <p>The look I gave him must have said something, like <i>maybe</i> I wasn't going to take any more of his bullshit since he felt the need to retort.</p>
                <p>"Wouldn't you lose track of some little thing like sanity after living for over a millennium?"</p>
                <p>"That doesn't make you sound better." Annoyingly, he did have a point. I'd probably be more of a wreck than him after that long, <i>but he's still insane!</i> If he can play normal this well, why did he have to say something?</p><p></p>
