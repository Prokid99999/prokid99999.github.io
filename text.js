  <p>First things first: Humans are notoriously intolerant of their own species, so we ask that you respect, or, at the very least, refrain from attacking other species due to the fact that they are not your own. Discrimination between races will not be tolerated.</p><br><br><br><br> \
  <p>Second: while you may not be the best at magic, know that others have had many times your experience, and strength is not the only factor we judge.</p><br><br><br><br> \
  <p>Now, we can get to the introduction. Magic is a natural force given to intellegent species that binds us all together. It is a power that can be bent into whatever you please, as long as you know what shape you want it to end in. Attacks, protections, charms, hexes, curses, and so many more. 'Spell' is a general term for magic performing a task. Spells can be used for healing, finding an object or a person, allevating pain, and, really, whatever you can make it do.</p> \
  <p>Every species with magic has a limit of magical energy, called mana, that their body can hold. This limit varies greatly between species and even among a single species, you can have a subject who can burn many days' worth of electricity next to someone who can barely power a lightbulb for a minute.</p> \

  <h1 id='char' class=\"noza\">Noza</h1> \
  <div class=\"background\"> \
    <p>I'm walking to math class with my roommates and best friends, Mina and Airn. Mina looks like she's going to get some sleep during learning time. She's been doing pretty well, getting straight A's but almost never an A+. I'm starting to think she's trying to get lower grades so she has less attention on herself. Her girlfriend's and mine seems like enough. Really, she's the least attention-hungry succubus I know. She pays attention in class and answers questions while the others rule their classes. Like, seriously, they make up at least half of the student council. They can't even do it honestly! Whenever I walk past one, I feel a prickle of magic drawing my eyes to their skimpy clothes that can't be allowed through the dress code. There's something seriously wrong with our school if they allow students to walk around in bikini tops and have half their butts out of their shorts but pester Airn about her vest.</p> \
    <p>Speaking of her, Airn's less than thrilled. I bet she'd rather be doing magical equations than numerical, especially because she's failing. Mina and I have been doing our damndest to help, and she's been trying, but her grades have only gone from straight F's to D's. We're getting worried they're going to make her retake the grade, but it's so unfair. I've never seen someone get beaten quicker than Airn can beat them. During magic sparring, students line up to see who can last the longest against her. The record is about two minutes, set by Mina. The closest behind her is forty-five seconds. My personal theory is that she's hiding a bunch of protective magic items. That, along with what she denies is a natural gift for spell-casting, puts her up with some of the higher-level arch wizards here. So what if it takes her a while to figure out what number <i>X</i> is? She'll have your surrender in a quarter of that time.</p> \
    <p>\"So, what black-magic bullshit do you think Mrs. Johann has today?\" Airn asks. Both of us chuckle, ignoring whatever the crowd around us might think.</p> \
    <p>\"It's <i>math</i>! And she's not even a mage.\" Of course Mina would know. She says it's because she's a magic-born creature, even though slimes are magic-born and I wouldn't know whether Airn was a normal human or a god taking a stroll among us mortals.</p> \
    <p>\"She's still using dark magic! Mages use the mana in our bodies; she uses runes.\"</p> \
    <p>\"What, can you not come up with a spell to defend yourself?\" Dammit, I gave her an idea. Her eyes unfocus and glance around at a diagram nobody else sees while muttering ingredients and possible equations. Mina nudges her and says \"Eyes on the road\" like she wouldn't guide Airn through the whole school.</p> \
    <p>\"Aw, and we're at the worst hour of the day.\" Airn's face takes on the resigned and depressed expression she hides during math class.</p> \
    <p>\"Come on, it's supposed to be review.\" Honestly, the only real reason Airn's still taking math is because Mina's there. She would drop it immediately if her favorite person wasn't there and trying to teach her. To slightly more avail than Mrs. Johann, <i>might I add.</i> She <i>tries</i> if Mina's helping!</p> \
    <p>Once we're all seated, Mrs. Johann says, \"Alright, class, today we'll be reviewing fractions.\" Airn sighs, apparently loud enough for the teacher to hear.</p> \
    <p>\"Is there a problem, Miss Avalon?\"</p> \
    <p>\"No, ma'am!\" Airn says, with an impressive fake smile.</p> \
    <p>\"Then let's begin.\"</p><br> \
    <div class=\"continue\">~~&gt ~~&gt ~~&gt</div><br> \
    <p>This class is easy enough that I can look at a newer student down the row from me. They're a slime, and a young one at that. Their body is more liquid than solid, and they're having trouble staying in their seat. Mrs. Johann keeps giving them looks that make me bristle and them shrink. I want to beat our teacher to death with rocks, but I'm sure that would get me unflattering wanted posters, so I settle for solidifying my body in a position that makes me look busy and send a little ball of slime down the row.</p> \
    <p>When I get to the new slime's seat, I slide up the legs of their desk and arrange myself in a puddle on top of it. They stare at me, so I whisper, \"Hold up something to read.\"</p> \
    <p>They root through their bag and pull out a math textbook. I slip closer to them as they set it open on their desk. Mrs. Johann looks our way. I look at the pages and quietly order them to turn it right-side-up. They oblige, and I assume my humanoid form. Scaled down to the size of my hand. Between the pages of a math book.</p> \
    <p>\"How did you do that?\" They really <i>are</i> young. Their eyes are wide as they roam over my body, trying to make sense of it. Hopefully the teacher thinks they're really interested in math.</p> \
    <p>\"It's pretty simple, just imagine the surface of your body is made of something hard. Like ice.\" They look at their hand and close their eyes. The thin blue of their skin turns cloudy. I poke their hand, and it feels much harder than before.</p> \
    <p>\"Now imagine that ice thawing, so it's solid but not hard.\" They squint and the ice-blue of their skin shifts closer to what it was before. I poke them again, and find it worked excellently. Their skin is solid enough to move without much difficulty.</p> \
    <p>\"Congratulations! You're not a puddle anymore!\" Aww, they're so proud of themself. They don't even need to make their eyes bioluminescent to glow.</p> \
    <p>They shoot a worried look at my body-shaped statue. I cock my head at them; then I hear Mrs. Johann.</p> \
    <p>\"Miss Noza? Care to answer the question?\"</p> \
    <p>I solidify my little puppet, throw my consciousness across the room to my main body, unfreeze it, and look at the board in less than half a second. The problem she wrote isn't too hard. \"Seven over five.\"</p> \
    <p>\"You need to start paying attention, young lady.\" I want to yell that I will outlive her puny human life and I just did the damn problem.</p> \
    <p>\"I apologize for helping a fellow slime keep their body together. What was the question?\" Doesn't sound so good now, does it? I can feel Airn's wicked grin across the room; Mina shakes her head next to her. My pupil is giving me a pleading look. They would rather be a puddle than be in this situation.</p> \
    <p>\"Excuse me?\"</p> \
    <p>\"What was the question?\"</p> \
    <p>\"Who were you <i>helping?</i>\"</p> \
    <p>I gesture down the row to the slime. \"This kind young... I forgot to ask about your gender.\" I cock my head. \"And your name.\"</p> \
    <p>\"M-my name is Arna. I'm a- I'm a girl.\" She looks so pitiful. I bet the <i>goddamn glare</i> Mrs. Johann is aiming at her isn't helping either.</p> \
    <p>\"I was helping Arna keep her shape.\" The whole class is glancing between me and the teacher like we're about to beat each other up.</p> \
    <p>\"While you were supposed to be focusing on the lesson.\" Mrs. Johann's eyes are narrowed on me. Feels like she's trying to get a confession of a crime.</p> \
    <p>\"It's much easier to focus on math when you don't have to keep picking your body up off the floor.\" My back stays striaght. I did nothing wrong.</p> \
    <p>\"Well, if you have so much to teach, why don't you come up here?\" She's glaring at me with vengance in her eyes. I get out of my chair and walk up to the board. Mrs. Johann takes my seat, to my annoyance. Either way, I have a class to teach.</p> \
    <p>\"Hello, everyone! Welcome to Slime Biology.\" I use a tendril of slime to grab the eraser off the whiteboard and erase the math problem. I bet Airn would be cheering if we weren't in class.</p> \
    <p>I write the words 'Slime Biology' on the board, and someone asks, \"How did you do that?\"</p> \
    <p>\"Raise your hand if you have a question!\" Ms. Johann snaps. They look down.</p> \
    <p>\"I believe I'm in charge of this class, Miss Johann. Please try to be kind, and if you don't have anything kind to say, please keep your mouth shut.\" Half the class, including Ms. Johann, is staring at me in disbelief, and the rest is staring in awe.</p> \
    <p>\"Any more questions about the expectations in my classroom?\" I look around at the students. One boy speaks for the whole class when he asks, \"We can just... talk?\"</p> \
    <p>\"You should give everyone who wants to speak a chance, but yes.\" I wait a second for any more questions. It's disappointing how confused they are.</p> \
    <p>\"I believe you had a question?\" I look at the person who spoke up first. \"How I wrote this on the board?\" I say, gesturing at the words.</p> \
    <p>\"Y-yeah...\"</p> \
    <p>\"I put some slime on the board and changed its color.\"</p> \
    <p>\"I'm sure you all know that slimes can change their shape, but how many of you know how much control we can have?\" Nobody volunteers. \"How many of you know the extent of our power? How many of you would know that I was a slime if I <i>tried</i> to look human?\" I shift my body, changing colors, firmness, texture, shape, until I'm in my human disguise. \"How many of you can tell I'm not an average person?\"</p> \
    <p>\"Your mana looks a lot different!\" Airn calls.</p> \
    <p>\"Really? What's the difference?\" I focus on her, getting eager to prove to Ms. Johann that my friend is smarter than the rock she seems to think Airn is.</p> \
    <p>\"Untrained humans have mana bouncing around all over their bodies. At the very least, you know how to control the flow of your magic.\" She shrugs. \"Maybe you're a mage, maybe you just like meditating. Who knows?\"</p> \
    <p>\"You don't?\" Her eyes narrow, taking the bait. I have the sudden thought of Airn duelling Ms. Johann.</p> \
    <p>\"Slimes have a particular way of manipulating their mana, just like every other magic-born.\" She leans back, slipping into a confident pose.</p> \
    <p>\"How do I manipulate mine?\" Ms. Johann is looking at Airn with a question in her eyes. I bet she's wondering why the best mage in the school chose to learn about magic instead of math, completely missing the rather important detail that Airn <i>does</i> want to be good at math. Even if it's only so she can get to the next grade.</p> \
    <p>\"Every cell in your body is bound to a tiny piece of mana. You take that magic and move it around, change it, and because it's part of a cell, the cell moves and changes with it. It's a very difficult style of magic for humans to replicate- we just don't have enough control to bind mana into more than a few cells at a time.\"</p> \
    <p>\"Look at that, even I'm learning something today,\" I say to the class.</p> \
    <p>\"It's nothing special. Most magic-born couldn't tell you how they use magic; they just understand that it's natural.\" There's her smug look. Well, maybe not <i>smug</i>, but she knows she's right and is ready to take anyone who disagrees to the sparring gym. Mina's eyes look perfectly normal even though she's staring at Airn. I bet it's taking everything in that unnaturally attractive skull to not make out with her right here.</p> \
    <p>\"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to use the restroom.\" Airn starts to get up, and is rudely interrupted by Ms. Johann.</p> \
    <p>\"You need-\"</p> \
    <p>\"You can go.\" I wave her on and pin the old bat with a glare. I would rather <i>not</i> have students pissing themselves, even though I doubt that's what Airn is going to the bathroom for.</p> \
    <p>\"Any other questions?\"</p> \
    <br> \
    <p>A few minutes later, Airn hasn't come back and I notice that Mina is gone. Looks like I was right. Anyway, I answer more questions, and Airn comes back. Mina shows up too, and both of them look normal. Aside from the slight sheen of magic over them. They don't speak up for the rest of class, so I finish it up and dismiss everyone.</p> \
    <br> \
    <p>As we walk to the cafeteria, Mina takes off the magic hiding how disheveled the two are. It's not that bad, honestly. Mina's hair is a little messy, both of their shirts are ruffled, and they're both blushing, but that's it.</p> \
    <p>\"You two have fun?\" I'm being cheeky, I know.</p> \
    <p>\"Hell yeah! That was the best class I've taken here!\" She can't be lying with her eyes lit up like that, and it's not just from her alone time with Mina.</p> \
    <p>\"But you couldn't wait fifteen minutes?\"</p> \
    <p>\"Yeah, sorry about that.\" Mina's predicably sheepish. Airn grins and says, \"I've been told I'm irresistible.\"</p> \
    <p>\"Well, I've got a slime to go see.\" Now Airn's looking cheeky.</p> \
    <p>\"Did you pull her in <i>ten minutes?</i>\" I mean, I've been known to sleep around, but I need <i>at least</i> half of to one hour to get to know someone. I have low standards, not <i>no</i> standards.</p> \
    <p>\"No, just talking slime things.\" She's got a shit-eating grin now.</p> \
    <p>\"And you need to go to <i>her</i> room for that?\"</p> \
    <p>\"Nah, we're going to bond over dinner.\"</p></div> \
    </div>",

  <h1 id='char' class=\"airn\">Airn</h1> \
  <div class=\"background\"> \
    <p>Mina walks over to my desk. I sense her without my eyes or ears; a presence combined with a unique, shifting flow of mana marks the person-shaped object behind me as my girlfriend. I've explained it to her before, probably more than once. Focusing on one person's mana for long enough lets you recognize patterns you wouldn't otherwise. It's like staring at someone's face until you memorize it. Plus, monitoring someone's mana is easier (<i>and a lot less weird</i>) than staring them down for hours at a time.</p> \
    <p>She hugs me and sits in the chair next to mine. I want to light my homework on fire and wrap my arms around her and touch her and kiss her and fall asleep next to her.</p> \
    <p>Instead, I show her my math homework, covered in handwritten equations and scribbled-out swears. The school requires an 80% in math to continue to the next grade. I have less than fifty percent after studying long past midnight for a minimum of five days a week. What have I learned? How to destroy my health and put on a mask.</p> \
    <p>I just want to stay in the same grade as Mina. The teasing I would recieve for being held back can be fixed easily. Show the class one sparring match and I'm shiny as a clean dagger. What doesn't make sense is why I would have to retake a grade with 110% in <i>every magical class.</i> This is a <i>magic</i> school. Why do I need to learn math? How the hell does putting numbers together make me a better mage? <b><i>It fucking doesn't</i></b>. Anything more than basic arithmetic is unnecessary. Mana isn't something that can be measured. Arch-mages are called arch-mages because they're so goddamn powerful everybody is too afraid to compare them to regular magic users. Why is this school forcing me to lose hours every day shoving techniques I'll never use into my skull?</p> \
    <p>\"Airn?\" Mina drags me out of my thoughts with a tired look. I don't like that she's losing sleep over this too... but I'm happy she's next to me. I wonder if I'm selfish for thinking that.</p> \
    <p>\"Sorry...\" I don't care right now. I want to be done with this bullshit so I can go to bed.<br> \
    ...Too bad I won't be able to enjoy cuddling with her.</p><br> \
    <div class=\"continue\">~~&gt ~~&gt ~~&gt</div><br> \
    <p>I wake up to Mina gently shaking me. Sometimes I think she couldn't hurt anyone if she tried, but I'll be reminded of how dangerous she can be when we get to sparring. History of our relationship aside- I say good morning and climb out of bed to put some clothes on. Doesn't really matter which shirt I wear with my vest, I only care about the sleeve length.</p> \
    <p>Mina got me up around ten minutes before we have to start walking to class. I have enough time to get my backpack ready and eat whatever Mina and Noza brought me from breakfast. I'm too hungry and not conscious enough to resist. I can't spend first period waking up on an empty stomach, after all.</p> <br><br><br> \
    <p>My thoughts turn to violence as soon as I finish waking up. I overheard a group of succubi gossiping about me and Mina, something about me seeing some guy I don't know. Noza would run with it, say some shit like \"He was <i>really</i> boring, didn't even last five minutes!\" without ever knowing who they were talking about. Mina would act like she doesn't care and tell me not to listen to them.</p> \
    <p>I spent my next three classes thinking about how best to humiliate those bitches.</p> \
    <p>If they were talking about Mina or Noza, I would tell them and let them deal with it. It's not my place to act. They've made that very clear. Me, though... I knocked out every kid who called me a faggot with my bare hands. Worth every trip to the principal's office. Used my time there to get the sparring mats, too.</p> \
    <p>I'm finished premeditating my assault by the time we get to the gym. They want a reaction, I'll give 'em a damn show.</p> \
    <p>Scoping the group out wasn't hard; they're succubi, they can't be subtle if their lives depend on it. Except Mina, obviously. I used a little spell to ensure I know their clan, so I can call them out directly. Shows how unknown they are. They wouldn't've messed with me unless they were looking for attention.</p> \
    <p>\"Boylusters!\" My voice echos across the gym. Every head turns to me; people snicker, cringe and outright laugh at the name. Mina raises her eyebrows. Noza settles in excitedly. The clan in question is giving me odd looks. \"I challenge you to a duel.\"</p> \
    <p>\"Oh? \" sneers the bitchiest-looking one, probably their leader. \"Go one at a time, if that's what you need.\" She's trickier than I thought, thinks she knows how to manipulate a crowd.</p> \
    <p>\"All of you. Fight me all at once, 'cause that's what you need for a fraction of a chance.\" A demon grin cracks my face. The crowd looks at me like I'm insane. Mina shakes her head and Noza throws a thumbs-up. The little bitches who're gonna fight me? Their eyes could rip someone to shreds.</p> \
    <p>\"You wanna go?!\" I wish I could frame her face, she's fucking livid. Her clan circles the mat I'm standing on. My mana rises at the danger, thrumming warm through my bones. Its power makes me light and reckless. It burns away the fog from this morning and leaves me in need of an outlet. Only magic and Mina can make me feel like this.</p> \
    <p>Some unseen signal makes my opponents' mana flare in sync, rearing like gasoline in a fire. Amateurs. All amatures. Half their spells fail, the mat choking their magic before they can kill me. The rest fire short little strings of Sun-bright power. I tally their blasts, marking angles, strength and type on pure instinct to weave shreds of armor tailored exactly to their attacks. Time resumes its normal pace as their magic strikes me and splatters off. My wonderful fabric leaps off of me to swallow every delicious drop of burning power and strokes the fire out of its catch. Finally, it returns to me, winding new threads onto my nearly full spool of mana.</p> \
    <p>You could kill boars with the shock on their faces. The crowd is cheering, Mina looks torn between impressed and concerned, Noza starts clapping. I feel sick. That spell overfilled my body's mana limit, which my vest will take care of, but evidently magic doesn't like being stolen. Feels like a groggy bear. I ensured their power can't hurt me, even if it doesn't want to be in my body. Any spells I cast with it will be unstable. Could be worse, I guess.</p> \
    <p>Even so, I'm going to keep this one on the shelf. Use it when people need reminders of how strong I am or to enforce my strength like right now. Anyway, my opponents throw a few spells for me to brush off before admitting defeat. There's a couple more challengers I take care of quickly before Mina steps up.</p> \
    <p>Oh, Mina. She walks up casually, like we're going to hug instead of fight. Her hair is tied in a ponytail to keep it out of her face, a look I only see here but wouldn't mind seeing more often. There's a glove on her right hand, a deep red fishnet stretching from her middle three fingers to about a palm below her wrist. Magic seethes through it. I draw my wand from its holster in my vest, a long, lighter-colored stick carved into a handle and a point. Mina's power comes into sharper focus when I hold it. I can almost anticipate the way her mana shifts, almost predict the direction.</p> \
    <p>It doesn't flare all over when she casts, only a heartbeat pump through her arm. A string of power shoots somewhere out of her hand. My instincts pick it apart, but it has too many layered folds. I have to twist out of the way rather than block it. She gives me a cocky little smile. <i>Got you,</i> it seems to say. No way that spell would've done any more than take a little bit of my mana, but still.</p> \
    <p>I launch my own spell, feeling hot power pump through my arm and out of my wand. It's hard to keep under control. It would be harder if I hadn't spent years training myself to conceal my casting. Mina gracefully spins out of its path, then makes a clumsier twist out of instinct. My spell chases after her. She dodges a few more spells from me and sends an unguarded plume of magic straight up while concealing her mana. Clever. That trick sends my spell whistling through empty air and into the wall of the mat's arena. Mina... Mina's not where I left her. I whip around, making a barrier just in time to block a spell from slamming into my face. I can't help but grin. <i>Almost got me!</i></p> \
    <p>She's grinning too. <i>That spell was a real piece of work. How did you come up with it?</i> I chuckle; <i>How do you think?</i></p> \
    <p>My eyes find their way to her chest, hidden under a high-cut shirt. Her necklace is hanging over it.</p> \
    <p>I blitz her, standing next to her before she can start blinking. My hand finds the small heart pendant and tucks it back under her collar. Nobody else needs to see it; we can keep it between myself and Mina. I return to my position as she finishes blinking.</p> \
    <p>Mina touches her shirt where the pendant was. Her eyes widen when she discovers it's a layer lower than she thought, then shift into gratitude. I give her a warm smile. I don't know how she thinks I did it, but that doesn't matter right now. We're supposed to be fighting.</p> \
    <p>I throw another spell at her. She smirks as she dodges, sidestepping like she had always intended to. I cast a barrier with my wand hand and spread the rest of my fingers. I don't really try to conceal my casting, weaving five scorching strings of magic into spells homing in on Mina. Her eyes widen and she dodges one, barely misses the second. She tries that magic flare again, but I bend my power towards her.</p> \
    <p>All five spells hit at once, bringing Mina to all fours. Her mana burns down to almost nothing. I shove my wand into its holster, rush over to her and put my hands on her shoulders, chanting a spell that forces her body to replenish its magic. It drains my own mana pretty quickly. If I didn't have my vest, I would only be able to get her standing before I collapse. Luckily, I only take it off in our room after classes. I can fully restore her mana and only empty one of the power cells along my spine.</p> \
    <p>The grimace on her face says I'm probably going too fast, but I'd rather have her uncomfortable than dead. I need to make a safeguard to keep that from happening again.</p> \
    <p>\"I'm sorry,\" I whisper into her ear. \"I'm really sorry. Are you okay?\"</p> \
    <p>She gives me a small smile and breathes, \"I'll be fine.\" Then she stands up, brushes some hair out of my face. \"You're already thinking of how to keep me safe. I love you.\"</p> \
    <p>My train of thought slips off its tracks. All I can say is \"I love you too.\"</p> \

    <p>After Airn's sparring escapade, the rest of our classes pass with little issue. There was a pop quiz in Math that wore Airn down more than usual, but that was it. She's transitioning into a walking corpse faster than in the past. I'm worried, of course, but she's taken it standing up for years. I don't like that she can barely function as a human on Fridays or that she has to sleep Friday night to Sunday morning to get out of bed after a week of school, or that her eyebags only get lighter instead of disappearing, but I won't downplay her abilites. She could have executed Mrs. Johann or threated the school. Airn is capable of taking out the entire staff of the First Magical Academy of the United States of America. She chooses to sacrifice her own well-being instead of hurting adults she doesn't like. That means something, even if only two people know Airn is already an arch mage.</p> \
    <p>I walk up behind Airn and wrap my arms around her, put my chin on her head, aware I can't surprise her.</p> \
    <p>\"Hey, honey.\" My eyes slide closed. I'll take every second I can get with her, just existing with her before I supervise her math. I know she has to get it done and I know she knows, too. Doesn't make either of us like it any more.</p> \
    <p>\"Hi.\" She puts a hand over mine and my heart flutters in its cage. I love her more than the sun, and she probably can't feel every little reaction my body and mind have when she touches me or says something, but surely Airn can sense it. My wonderful devil can </p> \
