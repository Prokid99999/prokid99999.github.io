        <p>
        He/Him<br>
        Male<br>
        17<br>
        Ceterosexual<br>
        Heat Manipulation<br>
        Human (Gifted)<br><br>
        Cool, calm and effecient with everyone outside Squad 1-S, and especially not Maven. They're the only person he can <i>really</i> show his feelings to.<br>
        He spends every day he's not hunting reading reports of Gift hunts, descriptions of the fights, deaths and all the horrors that come with Gift hunting.<br><br>
        A big assumption about ceterosexuality is the fact that it's attraction to nonbinary people, so the person has to know that someone is nonbinary to be attracted to them: "I like them because they're enby."<br>
        I obviously can't tell you how someone else's sexuality works, but I <i>can</i> explain Ess's reactions. He was never really attracted to anybody until Maven came out to him, and was inexplicably flustered around them. It's not about choosing to like someone because of their gender, because that's not how humans work.
