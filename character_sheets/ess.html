        <p>
        He/Him<br>
        Male<br>
        17<br>
        Ceterosexual<br>
        Heat Manipulation<br>
        Human (Gifted)<br><br>
        Cool, calm and effecient with everyone outside Squad 1, and especially not Maven. They're the only person he can <i>really</i> show his feelings to.<br>
        He spends time every day reading reports of Gift hunts, descriptions of the fights, deaths and all the horrors that come with Gift hunting.<br><br>
        A big assumption about ceterosexuality is the fact that it's attraction to nonbinary people, so the person has to know that someone is nonbinary to be attracted to them: "I like them because they're enby."<br>
        I obviously can't tell you how someone else's sexuality works, but I <i>can</i> explain Ess's reactions. He was never really attracted to anybody until Maven came out to him, and was inexplicably flustered around them.
