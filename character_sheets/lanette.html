        Her usual outfit is a long-sleeve, white flannel shirt with a black T-shirt on top, black thigh-highs, black knee-length shorts, arm warmers and sometimes a skirt<br>
        For looks, she has shoulder-length black hair with a purple streak, dark skin, a pretty average build and large chest <span class="hid" onclick="toggle()">[for reference, Holly and Mande are on the smaller side and Sasha's don't show through her clothes]</span><span id="clickme" style="display: none; color: #333;">[i have to have big tits somewhere]</span><br><br>
        has either emotional dysregulation or is hyperthymic, just really strong emotions; the two biggest being arousal and rage, meaning she's usally either horny or pissed<br>
        She's picky about touch because she gets aroused easily; it doesn't really matter where <span class="hid">['picky' as in she can get violent if someone surprises her by touching]</span> As such, grabbing her is a very bad idea and should only be done with consent<br>
        <br>
        She tries to use sex as a last resort to keep her hypersexuality from acting up <span class="hid">[read: <i>committing a crime MASK would kill her for</i>]</span>
