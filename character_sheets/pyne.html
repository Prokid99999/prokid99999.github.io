        <h1 style="color: #674ea7; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Pyne (Pynara)</h1>
        <p>
        She/They (Demigirl)<br>
        Female<br>
        Bisexual<br>
        One of Pyna's short swords<br>
        Worker Drone-Shadow Demoness<br><br>
        The tails of Pyna's coin.<br>
        I like staying in Pyna's head, but sometimes I go outside for one reason or another. I can take control of her limbs, but that's a drastic measure to keep her from doing something she'll probably regret, like when she jumped to kill Morie once she figured out what-ah, <i>who</i> he was. I can also use my mind to help her in a swordfight. Umm... what else...<br>
        Well, my personality is kind of the opposite of Pyna's. It's not a perfect opposite, of course, but... It's kind of like I'm a Pyna from a different timeline, one who grew up to be a different person with the same roots. I know everything about her, how to calm her down and keep her on the right track. Like a second opinion... Heh, a devil on her shoulder.<br>
        She's the angel.</p>
        <p><strong>Maybe I should make this clear:<br>
            I don't try to control her.<br>
            I'm not that kind of sick bitch, and she's gone through enough with that kind of person.<br>
            She <i style="color: red;">chooses</i> to listen to me.</strong></p>
            <p><b>Domain Expansion:</b> Mind's Eye<br><i>About 2x the normal size of a domain expansion</i><br>
            Opens on either an unending, dark forest or pure black with only the Shadow Demoness' eyes visible. Their Domain is completely under Pyne's control, as it is a shadow of the Mindscape rather than their own mind. It leaves the body of every person within paralyzed as whatever horrors she has planned for the unlucky sap happens in their mind.
