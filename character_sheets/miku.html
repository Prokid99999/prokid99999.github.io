        Cursed Technique<br>

        Cursed Technique: Virtual Idol<br>
        1st Grade Sorcerer<br><br>
        Miku Hatsune made a Binding Vow sacrificing her ability to generate her own cursed energy for the ability to siphon cursed energy from her fans.<br>
        Her cursed technique consists of a beam of cursed energy called "Miku Miku Beam." It is activated by saying "beam" and holding two fingers pointed in a 'V' next to an eye. "Miku" can be said up to twice before "beam" as a sort of chant, and another hand can be used to increase power further.<br><br>
        The full chant is:<br>
        "And now..."<br>
        "It's time!"<br>
        "For the moment you've been waiting for!"<br>
        "One!"<br>
        "Two!"<br>
        "Three!"<br>
        "Ready?"<br>
        "Miku Miku BEAM!"<br>

        Domain Expansion: Colorful Stage<br>
        The inside of this domain is, as the name implies, a stage with a crowd. Hatsune is placed onstage as a performer while others are placed in the crowd.<br>
        Its purpose is to give Hatsune time to say the full chant of Miku Miku Beam.<br>
        Hatsune uses a full-body pose to activate her domain, as opposed to the traditional hand sign. The only requirement is "a pose an idol would strike onstage."<br>
