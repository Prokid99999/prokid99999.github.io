        <p>
            He/Him<br>
            Male<br>
            Aroace<br>
            Longsword<br>
            Demon Worker Drone<br><br>
            The leader of MASK with a split personality.<br>
            Ben is always calm and collected, even while killing people. The only visual difference between him and B is his eyes, glowing pure blue.<br>
            Relies on Pyna to stay sane, referring to her as his "heart"<br>
            Believes that sex offenders and pedophiles, among others, deserve death.<br>
            Runs an assassin group called MASK, whose goal is to rid the world of the people listed above.<br><br>
            One of the very few times he lost control, he slaughtered all but one person from a corrupt religious town whose leaders executed an innocent woman named Eterramys for "siding with a demon"<br><br>
            B is a being of raw, pure rage and violence, eager and willing to kill MASK's targets without question or hesitation. When he's in control, his left eye turns red. Otherwise very similar to Ben.<br><br>
            "Don't let your anger control you" is a well-known saying. I agree with it; making decisions with anger often isn't a good idea. The problem is that it makes people see anger as a weakness, similar to showing sadness. They think the only thing anger can do is control them. 
            One of the few techniques I have is using my anger without letting it drive me. Fuelling my body with rage while keeping my mind cold.<br><br><br>
            That's what makes me an unstoppable force.
