        I don't know what to put for a character description.<br>
        I guess that's a part of my character, I have a hard time putting my thoughts into words, or maybe I can't decide which words to use, or I don't know which thoughts to write down.<br>
        For example, Ben is a sort of persona, but I don't necessarily think of him as <i>me.</i> I don't think that's an example...<br><br>
        I've noticed a lot of similar themes in my writing, like some extreme mental condition, a mental breakdown, and sex. All of my stories involve sex. I don't know why, and that's kind of what this is for; figuring myself out.<br><br>
        I can be very cold if I want to. </p>

        <p>I'm taking driver's ed right now, and every single time they mention teen drivers, they say <i>"Every teen is incapable of handling new situations and thinks they are invincible, that they can't possibly be the one to cause/die in an accedent."</i><br>
        <i>I</i> don't have a god complex. <i>I</i> know that if I fuck around while driving a car, I'll die. I'm aware I exaggerated that quote and that's not exactly what they said, but that's how it feels.<br><br>
        The biggest motivator to drive well is the little interviews with parents who have lost their children to driving. It hurts to hear, and I'd be ripping myself apart in hell if I made my mom feel that.
