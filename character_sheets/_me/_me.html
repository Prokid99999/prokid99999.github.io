        I don't know what to put for a character description.<br>
        I guess that's a part of my character, I have a hard time putting my thoughts into words, or maybe I can't decide which words to use, or I don't know which thoughts to write down.<br>
        For example, Ben is a sort of persona, but I don't necessarily think of him as <i>me.</i> I don't think that's an example...<br><br>
        I've noticed a lot of similar themes in my writing, like some extreme mental condition, a mental breakdown, and sex. All of my stories involve sex. I don't know why, and that's kind of what this is for; figuring myself out.
