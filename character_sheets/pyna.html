        <h1 style="color: #00ff00;">Pyna</h1>
        <p>
        She/Her<br>
        Female<br>
        Physically and mentally 18, has been alive for two years<br>
        Demisexual<br>
        Twin Short Swords<br>
        Worker Drone<br><br>
        The shy, depressed power bottom.<br>
        Let's see, uh... What's interesting about me?<br><br><br>
        <i>(An inner conflict about Ben)</i>
        <br>The kindest man I've ever met.<br>
        <strong><i>A MASS MURDERER</i></strong>
        <br>He'll defend me, but he knows I can handle myself most of the time.<br>
        <strong><i>COLD, UNCARING AND MERCILESS</i></strong><br>
        The only person I could trust or even feel safe talking about my feelings and mental state with when I was younger.<br>
        <strong><i>SIX HUNDRED </i>THOUSAND<i> LIVES ON HIS HANDS</i></strong><br>
        I trust him more than Valorie, probably as much as Pyne.<br>
        <strong><i>HE CAN KILL ME WITH A WAVE OF HIS HAND</i></strong><br>
        I will put my life in his hands without question.<br>
        <strong><i>HE IS A REAL, LIVING DEMON<br>
        DEATH AND DESTRUCTION INCARNATE</i></strong><br>
        That doesn't mean anything.<br>
        <strong><i>...<br>
        YOU ARE HOLDING A KNIFE TO YOUR THROAT</i></strong>
        <br>If I am, it's the dull side.<br><br><br>
        <span class="hidden">Throughout MBCKG, it feels like Pyna chases a sexual high. I didn't <i style="color: black;">specifically</i> write her like that, it's just something I noticed.<br>
        A piece of lore somewhat related to this is the fact that while most people would get burnt out of doing one sex position or method of sex every time, she gets more aroused with familiarity (whether it's with a person, position or otherwise)</span>
